PROJECT TITLE: Growth of Microbrewery in Illinois, Colorado, Michigan and Wisconsin

TEAM: Mark Green, Stephanie Armenta, Richard Robinson

DESCRIPTION: Our mission is to establish the current density of Microbrewery in targeted states by count and location in efforts to identify new growth and/or entrepreneurial opportunities.

DATA: Microbrewery data from Kaggle with over 7000 data sets.

QUESTIONS: Where are the locations? What are the hours of operation?  Which state has the most microbrewery?  Where are the opportunities?  
PRODUCTION TOOLS: Tableau, Machine Learning, Python Panda, Power Point, Plotly, MongDB

BACKGROUND: A microbrewery or craft brewery is a brewery that produces small amounts of beer, typically much smaller than large-scale corporate breweries, and is independently owned. Such breweries are generally characterized by their emphasis on quality, flavor and brewing technique.

DATA SHORTCOMINGS:  Ability to discern whether each location was a stand alone Microbrewery or combination restaurant.  Ascertaining production by volume of each entity to compare size.
