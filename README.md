PROJECT TITLE: Growth of Microbrewery in Illinois, Colorado, Michigan and Wisconsin

TEAM: Mark Green, Stephanie Armenta, Richard Robinson

DESCRIPTION:  Our mission is to establish the current density of Microbrewery in targeted states by count and location in efforts to identify new growth and/or entrepreneurial opportunities.

DATA: Brewery data from Kaggle

QUESTIONS:  Where are the locations?  Which of the selected states has the most? Where are the opportunities?

TOOLS TO PRODUCE: Matplotlib, Tableau, Machine Learning, Panda, Power Point, MongoDB

BACKGROUND:

A microbrewery or craft brewery is a brewery that produces small amounts of beer, typically much smaller than large-scale corporate breweries, and is independently owned. Such breweries are generally characterized by their emphasis on quality, flavor and brewing technique.



















DATA: Use of Microbrewery data from Kagggle with over 7000 data sets.
